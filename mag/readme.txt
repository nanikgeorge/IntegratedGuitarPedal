Welcome to the Integrated Guitar Pedal Magic Folder - it's a mess (sorry)

The top level magic file is tt_um_guitar_pedal.mag, it will throw some errors about
missing pcells when you open it, I don't know why, I didn't use those pcells.

If you don't want to see those errors, a flattened view exists - tt_um_guitar_pedal_flat.mag
